Project Scope Creep Queue
	All items here are ideas that I want to add, but should wait until base game is built
	
Easier to implement
	show healthbar and mana bar
	have an action to regenerate mana?
	get player name
	Customize Party
		Select 3 party members
			set class
			set character name
			select sprite
	Save game
		save party, number of victories all other data to file
	Load Game
		load data from file
	Experience tracking
		vary experience gained by what was defeated
		store experienced gained on CHARACTERS
	Spell selection
		different spells have different effects
		different characters have different spells
	Hide Action Menu after character turn
		hide or disable action buttons
		resize battle display?
			
Harder to implement
		Dynamically generate action menu
			receives an event, generates a list of buttons, each button calls a specified event.
			So instead of everyone having the same action menu, it is customized to what each character can do.
				Opens up the ability to do things like different heroes having different spells.
			OR
			Simply use comboboxes to list possible actions, and have events populate that on turn start?
		Encounter scaling
			Difficulty of encounters scales with how long game has been going (Not just what encounters, but buffs monsters)
		Leveling
			characters can level up
			OR
			Player levels up, and it affects all characters?
		Items
			healing items
		Mid-battle screen
			Heal party members
			level up party members
			Change party configuration?
			Encounter selection
				Allow player to choose next encounter from a list of possible encounters
