RPG Project to do:
	Create Dice Class again
		instead of passing random to Mob pass Dice
		potentially do the same for other classes
	Add Defend functionality to Mob
	Have the type of damage get relayed by Attack commands
		Have HIT run different logic depending on type of damage
			magic
			physical
	Add Special Attack functionality to Mob
		throw exception
		subMobs
			mage magic spell
			Orc damage multiplier for magic spells 
			Dragon special attacks
	GameEngine
		endgame
			game over
				Display results (rounds lasted)
				Display leaderboard button
			victory
				save data to file
					just update save data before each battle
					new file for each game
				start a new battle
		after battle
			heal all Heroes
	Battle
		Setup encounter generation to generate different encounters
			first 1 bandit (tutorial)
			then 3 bandits
			then 2 Orcs
			then 1 dragon
			then 5 bandits
			then 2 Orcs 3 Bandits
			then 3 bandits 1 dragon
			then randomized selection of:
				Perhaps use combat level to determine maximums and num of villains
				up to 1 dragon, if so generate max 3 other mobs
				up to 5 bandits
				up to 3 orcs
			or something

Future ideas:
	In save data keep track of more data:
		number of dead Heroes
		number of dead enemies
			count for each type of enemy
		whether a Game over or not
		Possibly XML format or something

		load an existing (but not lost) save.
	Darkest Dungeon style, when a Mob dies dont revive it, create a new one.
	Implement spell selection
	GameEngine
		Add character naming and selection
		EndGame
			if Victory
				show new Battle results userControl instead of BattleForm
					show results
					tell user progress has been saved
					tell user progress has been saved
					button to start next battle
					button to start new game
	Implement tutorial for first round
		make skippable
