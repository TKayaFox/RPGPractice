Finals Fantasy:
	Create a RPG style battle system (Final fantasy, pokemon etc).
Does not have:
	Story
	50+ hours of content
	leveling system
	adventuring
		just encounter after encounter
		roguelike style
------------------------------------------
Process Plan:
	Week 1:
		Lay out gameplay PLAN for iteration 1.
		UML Use Case Diagram
			user experience
			created in any program of choice
		UML Class Diagram
			created in uMLet or VisualStudio
		Mock up of game form
			created in visual studio
		Github Project plan with iterations
	iteration 1:
		GUI Classes:
			Form:
				constructor 
			battleField userclass
				constructor
					receives:
						monster array 	(up to X?)
						hero array		(up to X?)
					puts sprites for monsters on right or top
					puts sprites for heroes on left or bottom
					puts battle menu at bottom
				label InitiativeCurrent
					shows current turn in initiative order
				attack button
					raise event for physical attack
				spell button
					raise event for magic attack
				combat event multiline textbox
					listens to all events and displays combat events as a string (who does what for ?hp)
				Events:
					OnTryAttack
						sends TryAttack event
						packages in event
							who attacked
							what kind of attack
				Event Handlers:
					OnEnemyTurn_Handler
						unpacks event
						displays result of enemy attack
					OnPlayerTurnStart_Handler
						unpacks whose turn it is
						sets turn label to whose turn it is
						possibly prompt user for whose turn it is
					OnAttack_Handler
						display results of attack in box
					OnDeath_Handler
						unpack who died
						display who died
						discolor sprite of dead character
					OnBattleEnd_Handler
						Display message box with game state result
		Engine Classes:
			Hero abstract class:
				strengh
				intelligence
				physical attack
				magical attack
				physical defernse
				magical defense
				hit points
				skill points
				initiative speed	
				userControlled (boolean)
				subclass warrior:
					physical damage
					high physical defense
					weak to magic
					
				
	iteration 2:
		GUI Classes:
			form:
				constructor
					initialize with new game menu userClass
					no longer initialize with new battlefield
			newgame userclass
				Take users name for each hero
				Start game button
					calls startGame event
			battleField
				constructor
					receives:
						battlefield image?
			
			
				
		build game class
			holds an array of Heroes
			holds number of enemies defeated
			holds score/experience
		Build "Hero" abstract class
			build fighter subclass
			build "Monster" abstract subclass
				build "bandit" subclass
		build battlefield userclass
			generates a new monster
			Places Heroes on the battlefield
			Places a background
			places the monster
			label shows current "turn"

------------------------------------------
Classes:
	Heroes: Player controls 3 heroes that will take part in battle
	(Doesnt technically need to be these things, but show the different stats etc)
	
		class: (All heros have)
			Ability Scores:
				
		Subclasses
			Mage:
				magic damage
				low physical defense
				high magic defense
			Cleric:
				can heal other party members
				low attack
				medium defense (magic and physical)
			Bandit:
				low defense
				low hp
				physical attacks
				weak to all damage
				not very strong
			ogre:
				slow initiative
				high defense
				high physical attack
				weak to magic (damage multiplier)
				medium hit points
			dragon:
				strong attacks
					breathe fire (target one hero)
					swipe attack (target all heroes)
				slow
				strong againts both physical and magic attacks
				high hp
		Battlefield
			multiline (editing turned off) textbox for battle log
				who did what, what damage dealt etc.
			attack buttons
			monster and player sprites
			BAttle field sprites
			Initiative order
				Rolls all
		Game
			Number of enemies beaten
			score
			After every battle saves game statistics
		Form
			Holds a game window
			status strip
			menu bar
				new game
					Initializes a new game
				save game (saves game to file)
				
Turn in multiple parts:
	Pre production:
		UML diagram of classes in game
		UML Use Case Diagram
			in program of choice
		Mock up of game form
			created in visual Studio
		due 4/18
	PRogress Check
		at least one hero character and one enemy working for battle
		due 5/2
	Completed Project
		full implementation
		Plays well with no exceptions/erros in 10 min play period.
		Due 5/7/23
