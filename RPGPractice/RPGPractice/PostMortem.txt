Issues I ran into:
	- I spent a lot of time on organizing, which is nice to have, but might have gone beyond what is necessary.
	- I am not sure if I have done too many Classes, might have gotten TOO complicated. A lot of my initial plan was frankly bad. (Even after I polished it some from my initial submission...).
	- Honestly trying to MVP Model made things so much more chaotic. I ended up setting up an EventManager class because there just wasnt a good way to subscribe to the right parts. (The Engine class has a Battle Class/userform which has the Mobs that throw events. And the point of MVP is that it's completely seperate from the Engine part)
	- For the initiative, I ended up making my own class for the Initiative Queue because I got annoyed trying to figure out the native PriorityQueue for C#. Why did they make it so complicated when C version is just better?
		Anyways, ended up having to make what is essentially PriorityQueue from scratch, which there was probably a better solution
	- Theres a lot more refactoring that I would like to do, things got kind of messy...
