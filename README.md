Notes: 
I played with a lot of concepts that I had not worked with in the past for this project, several were not even taught in the class. I suspect osme ideas, uch as the EventManager, could be far better implemented.
My attempted vision for this project admittedly ended up broader than I had time for. Some of the solutions ended up being a little rushed, and I suspect I will needto do a lot of refactoring once I am able to do so.
I also have been trying tofigure out Git organization. The hope, was to have a "stable" branch where all commits were runnable versions of the game. At time of writing, I have not been able to do so, however I have learned a lot, and should theoretically be able to do so moving forward. Hopeully I can also clean up the existing branch a bit, though I may just replace it.
